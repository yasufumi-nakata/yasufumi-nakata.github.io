<div class="about_this_site">
  <span class="strong_blue">SKIP</span>is an application to put information sharing based on communications into practice.<br />
  <br/>
  The main targets are <span class="strong_blue">knowledge sharing</span> and <span class="strong_blue">promoting communications</span>.<br />
  It provides features designed to enable <span class="strong_blue">fun and meaningful communications</span> between users including job-related know-hows and even little chit-chats.<br />
  <br />
  Every SKIP user owns <span class="strong_blue">a personal page (called "My page")</span> so that everyone can publish and collect information.<br />
  One can write down and publish daily thoughts and know-hows acquired in relation with their jobs as <span class="strong_blue">blogs</span> and search for <span class="strong_blue">knowledge and information</span> published by other users.<br />
  <br />
  SKIP also allows users to create <span class="strong_blue">groups</span>.<br/>
  Users can find <span class="strong_blue">buddies with the same target and interests</span> by joining groups and make more meaningful commucications and accumulate <span class="strong_blue">know-hows</span>. They can also create groups by themselves.<br />
  <br />
  For more detailed explanations for the features and the usage, please refer to the <a href="http://help.skipaas.jp/" target="_blank">help documentations</a>.<br />
  There are lots of fun and useful features made ready for you to communicate and discover people, knowledge and information.<br />
